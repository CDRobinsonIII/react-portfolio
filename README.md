## Description 
The mission of this project was to create a React portfolio to display an about me section and a portfolio of the projects I have created to date. No starter code was provided for this project. I started the application using npx create-react-app. The portfolio information is stored in a portfolio.json file and is retrieved using set state. There is a simple navbar to switch between the home(about me) and portfolio pages.
